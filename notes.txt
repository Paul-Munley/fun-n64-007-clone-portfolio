NOTES ON MAIN MENU FUNCTIONALITY FOR NAV:
1) When you are moving through the navigation, the right tab is normally the previous button. There is then a middle nav most of the time where you can click located in the middle of the manila folders.
2) When there is more content on the page though, the menu options will then move to end up being tabs on the side. This would be great for when you are having pages be navigated on your site.
